<h2>About Us</h2>
GeorgiaTestReview.com is designed to meet the needs of Georgia High Schools.  The design and development of this
program evolved through the collaboration of Georgia public high school teachers.  Current Georgia teachers produced
all the materials for this site based upon years of preparing students for EOCT and GHSGT.

We built this with a number of goals in mind - practicality, simplicity, and usefulness.  The site design allows
for multiple uses. Teachers can use this for whole-group instruction in a computer lab. Also, portions of the site
are appropriate to use as class starters each day.   Diagnostic testing allows the identification of students at risk
of scoring poorly on tests.  For students who may already have failed the GHSGT, the web-based format allows users
to work on their review at home.  Finally, there is no need for training to use the site, and there is no software
to install on every computer in the school.

The review options are numerous, allowing users to review in many different formats.  Additionally, our upgrade
audio feature was designed by a special education teacher to help better prepare all students who have reading
difficulties. We envision this being helpful not only for students serviced through special education, but also
for ESOL students and others who simply may have a weakness in the area of reading.
